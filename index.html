            <h2>- About Me! -</h2>
            <p>I'm a Brazilian Teenager Indie Game Creator. I made a few simple games when i was 9 years old using Roblox Studio and then growing up with game engines.</p>
            <h2>- Work -</h2>
            <p>Currently i only make for myself / non-commercial games when i'm solo. But i'm right now working with my close friends in a studio which i founded with them called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gearsconnectionsofc/">Gears Connections.</a></p>

            <h2>- Skillset -</h2>
            <p>In terms of making games in Gears Connections & for me i work as a programmer, designer, animator, composer, director, artist and writer. For personal uses i'm learning how to became a author and inventor. Also i'm a Active Discord Bot Developer, so that means i work with bots for discord, usally i make some code for my bot. Yeah i know, thats a lot of thing to work as a one person, but i love getting skillsets! it's fun and one of my dreams is becoming a polymath!.</p>
